Here we go! The obligatory Hello World post for the blog.


My name is Kenny! I've always found tech blogs extremely helpful as a bridge between product documentation and project execution, and they have certainly gotten me un-stuck from many a pesky problem. Hopefully the content here will help someone else out, or at least provide an interesting read on something new. I enjoy birds, plants, and art history, so some of those topics might be sprinkled in as well!

The first iteration of this site is hosted on GitHub pages and rendered with Jekyll, using a slightly modified version of the [contrast](https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast) theme by niklasbuschmann. If anything changes, I'll update it on the site's [About]({% link about.md %}) page
